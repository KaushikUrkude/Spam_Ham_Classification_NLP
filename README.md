Spam/Ham Classification using CountVectorizer
1.Description: This project implements a spam/ham classification system using CountVectorizer, a text preprocessing technique, in NLP. It distinguishes between spam (unsolicited bulk messages) and ham (non-spam) emails or text messages.
2.Dataset: The project uses a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and ham messages. Each message is preprocessed and transformed into a numerical feature vector using CountVectorizer.
3.CountVectorizer: CountVectorizer is a text processing technique that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts, representing the frequency of each word in the documents. It prepares the text data for input into machine learning models.
4.Model Training: The preprocessed text data is used to train a machine learning model, such as a Random Forest classifier, to distinguish between spam and ham messages based on the extracted features from CountVectorizer.
5.Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in correctly classifying spam and ham messages.
